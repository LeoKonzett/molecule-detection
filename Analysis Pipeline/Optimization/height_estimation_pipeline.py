        The height distribution is NOT(!) the AFM cantilever tip. The height distribution can be
        used to simulate the tip-sample dilation for a one-pixel wide DNA backbone.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    analyzed_linear_DNA: list of arrays
        list of linear-only DNA strands. Each linear_DNA object holds its coordinate trace.
        
    max_radius: int
        the maximum distance up to which pixels around the trace are used to calculate the
        height distribution. On average, the intensity is zero for distances greater than 4.5
        
    symmetrize: bool
        indicates whether or not to ascertain radial symmetry of the distribution. On average
        the excentricity is 1.02, thus the symmetrizing option is not needed for the images at hand.
        Can be included for images with *very* few linear strands.
